    "## Overview: This code creates a list of bus stops in Washington DC most suitable to have trees planted at them. The code uses five metrics: High ridership,  Minority Population, Elderly Population, High poverty rates, and tempurature data to calculate suitabilty. \n",
    "## The code begins by creating a buffer layer around the bus stops to layer calculate the number of trees with a 30 ft range and combining all metric data into one table. Then an MCE was created to find the most suitable sites for trees. \n",
    "## This was done by calculating the z-scores for all metrics at all bus stop points, then standardizing all of the metric z-scores into a coomon scoring system. Lastly, each metric was seperatly weighted, and a final MCE was partially weighted for all metrics. \n",
    "## Finally, with each bus stop's MCE value calculated, the data set was limited to only bus stops without trees currently, and the top 10 most suitable bus stops were listed. \n",
    "## For this code, the datasets used were: A boundary of Washinghton DC, DC bus stops, a dataset of trees in DC, a tempurarture dataset, bus ridership data, and DC demographic data, DC economc data, \n",
